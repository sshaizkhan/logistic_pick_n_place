# LOGISTICS CASE PICKING

## SECOND DELIVERABLE

**Components detail and Implementation plan**

This deliverable is based on the solution presented in the first deliverable. The deliverable consists of brief summary 
of the components and technologies that are used in order to present a solution to the given logistic case picking problem.

Therefore, the various components used as are follows:

* **6 dof Robotic Manipulator**: The selection of the manipulator was based on its reachability and payload capacity. The manipulator 
  should be able to reach a height of 1.5m withing its workspace and carry load between 10 - 15 kg. Based on the given conditions, 
  ABB IBR2400 and IBR2600 would be best suitable for this task. It has reach of 1.55 - 1.85 respectively with load carrying capacity
  from 12 - 20 kg. To read more on, please [click here](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/industrial-robots/robot-selector)

* **Mobile Platform**: The need for the mobile platform because of the large distance between the pick and place position.
  Traditionally, the pick and place position are within the workspace of the robotic manipulator
